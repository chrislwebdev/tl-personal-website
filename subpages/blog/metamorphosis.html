          This article is about the perspective of a novice product designer in
          2023. One and a half years ago, when I first heard about user
          experience design, it felt like the missing piece in this highly
          industrialized and digitized world was found. We are all surrounded by
          thousands of physical and digital products, and a very small minority
          of them function to a high standard. Let's be honest, products mostly
          disappoint us. I have always been one of those people who complains
          non-stop about dysfunctional packaging and products, particularly how
          and why nobody puts the necessary effort and thought into the design
          before they were produced. So, when I heard about UX design, it was
          music to my ears. Briefly, I felt sad not to choose a profession like
          that, and then later thought I need a challenge like that, as well as
          a serious career change, in my late 30s.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I know it's a cliché, but I do believe that design is intelligence
          made visual, as in somebody fully comprehended the purpose of the
          product, put thought into each step, and designed it in a way in which
          it functions smoothly. It's as if the designer is saying, “Hello, I'm
          a good designer, or, if you prefer, the solution bringer.”

        <h3 class="blog-subheader">Being a self-taught designer</h3>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          As a new learner, it was hard to evaluate the merit of different
          learning resources, be it a mentor or a course. The nature of
          self-taught learning is that you are very likely to lose time and
          energy, meaning failing and learning is a big part of the process.
          Combined with the lack of feedback, a good learning road map to lead
          you to success, and the sheer confusion of numerous input from various
          design influencers, it might make becoming a designer sound like a
          hellish journey. Thankfully, it's not all doom and gloom. On the
          upside, there are absolutely no time restrictions, you go at your own
          pace, and you can choose whatever fits your learning style.

        <h3 class="blog-subheader">2023 Sector Conditions</h3>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I must admit that I feel very unlucky to have entered the industry at
          the stage it is currently at. Looking back, the way in which the
          internet and mobiles entered our lives seemed effortless. With direct
          access to people like never before, companies capitalized on the
          opportunity, central to which was their design decisions. Suddenly,
          those companies could earn millions with magic hat tricks – design
          practices that were newly discovered and proved to be highly effective
          for user-centered design, resulting in massive profits and making UX a
          new golden attraction - but the lack of experienced designer resulted
          in a boom of boot camps, who weren't necessarily interested in
          producing the new wave of talented UX designers, instead seeking quick
          profits themselves. Over the course of a few years, the lack of talent
          caused the image of UX designers to quickly deteriorate.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Still, companies were as expectant as ever, and the pandemic almost
          sent them giddy, hiring like never before in a quest to ensure the
          profits kept flowing. If there's one thing you can guarantee about a
          boom, however, it's that it's followed by a bust, and that bust came
          in the form of AI and global economic uncertainty. This has resulted
          in job openings being 70% less, and now, more than ever, the industry
          is saturated with self-proclaimed designers.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Perhaps the current state of the industry is a blessing in disguise. I
          can consider myself lucky in that I get to show my true love of
          design, and I get more and more competent as I wait for this storm to
          subside. As my design maturity increases, I can patiently wait for the
          day to come that I can convert good ideas into good products.
